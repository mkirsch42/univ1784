<p>
    Now both photons are travelling at the same speed and the contradiction has been fixed.
    However, the moving clock seems to tick slightly slower than the stationary one sine it must travel a longer distance at the same speed.
    This means that the moving clock must tick slower. Since a light-tick is a constant amount of time, the moving reference frame must experience time <b>slower</b> than a stationary one!
