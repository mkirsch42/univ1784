<p>
    An important tool in exploring Relativity is the time clock.
    A time clock emits a photon from one side, which reflects off a mirror and returns to a receiver.
    Each time the receiver detects a photon, a small amount of time is added to an internal clock.
    This mechanism allows us to measure the passage of time in terms of the speed of light.
    Note that since the length of the clock and the speed of light are constant, the time it takes for a photon to complete a round-trip must also be a constant amount of time.
    We can call this amount of time a light-tick.
