<p>
    An important tool in exploring Relativity is the time clock.
    A time clock emits a photon from one side, which reflects off a mirror and returns to a receiver.
    Each time the receiver detects a photon, a small amount of time is added to an internal clock.
    This mechanism allows us to measure the passage of time in terms of the speed of light.
