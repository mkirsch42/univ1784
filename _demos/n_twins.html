    One last example of Minkowski diagrams is a resolution of the Twin Paradox, where one twin flies away from the Earth at near light-speed, while one twin stays on Earth.
    Due to time dilation, each twin would argue that the other should be younger once they meet again.
    However, graphing the twin's round-trip relative to the twin on Earth shows that as the traveling twin decelerates and turns around, he effectively skips over a large portion of his Earth twin's timeline.
    Therefore, the twin on Earth will be older when they meet again.
