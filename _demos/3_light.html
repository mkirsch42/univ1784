title: "Speed of Light"
---

As a result of Einstein's Theory, the speed of light must stay constant in all non-accelerating reference frames.
If the speed of light changed in a "moving" reference frame, that would mean that you would be able to determine if you were moving by precisely measuring the speed of light.
This violates Einstein's theory!
