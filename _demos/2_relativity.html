<p>
    Before Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, it was believed that all movement was relative to a stationary, abolute reference frame.
    Einstein proposed that every reference frame that does not accelerate is identical and that there is, in fact, no absolute reference frame.
    This means that somebody in a train moving at a constant speed would be incapable of knowing they were moving without looking out the window.
    In fact, according to them, they would be stationary and the Earth would be moving under them!
