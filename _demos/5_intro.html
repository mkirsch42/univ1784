Since the speed of light is constant, the velocity of a moving reference frame cannot be added to the velocity of photons that it emits like you would for a regular object.
Doing so would cause the photons to travel faster than the speed of light in your reference frame!
Instead, a moving reference frame is perceived as experiencing time slowly.
