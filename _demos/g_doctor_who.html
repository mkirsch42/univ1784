<p>
    Though Doctor Who is typically very unrealistic in its time travel mechanisms, gravity time dilation was used in the episode "World Enough and Time".
    While the Doctor is close to the black hole, his companion, Bill, is 400 miles away, so the Doctor experiences time much slower than Bill.
