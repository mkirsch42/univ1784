    Interstellar is known to be one of the most realistic portayals of time travel in movies.
    The first major instance of time travel is on Miller's Planet, which closely orbits a black hole.
    A significant point of tension on Miller's planet was the fact that the nearby black hole's gravity dilated time so much that 1 hour on Miller's Planet was equivalent to 7 years on Earth.
    A more minor point is the ship's slingshot around the black hole costing them 51 years of Earth time.
