    Another interesting result of these experiments is the fact that reference frames moving at the speed of light seem to be frozen in time!
    As a reference frame increases in speed, a photon must spend more of its speed moving horizontally.
    In a reference frame moving at light speed, the photon spends all of its speed moving horizontally, so it will never move vertically.
    Therefore, the clock will never tick, meaning time does not appear to pass in such a reference frame.
    According to a photon, it moves instantly throughout the universe since the rest of the universe appears to be frozen.
