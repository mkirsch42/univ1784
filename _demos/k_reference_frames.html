<p>
    Non-stationary reference frames are represented by a line angled between the vertical axis and the 45-degree (since nothing can move faster than the speed of light).
    This line (ct') represents the reference frame's timeline.
    In order to keep the speed of light constant in the new reference frame, its spatial axis (x') is also angled the same amount as its time axis.
    Finally, the scales on the moving reference frame's axes are stretched based on its velocity.
