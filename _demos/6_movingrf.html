<p>
    In this demonstration, the blue light clock is stationary relative to the observer and the background, while the red light clock is moving.
    Notice that the red photon is travelling a longer distance than the blue photon since it must move both horizontally and vertically.
    Also notice that they tick at the same time, meaning that their periods are the same.
