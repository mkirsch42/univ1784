<p>
    In the previous demonstration, the red photon in the moving reference frame travelled a longer distance than the blue photon in the stationary reference frame.
    This leads to a contradiction: if time passes equally in both reference frames, the red photon must have been travelling faster than the blue photon.
    This means it must have travelled faster than the speed of light!
