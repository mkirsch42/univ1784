<p>
    Since gravity curves straight paths, a photon travelling in what appears to it as a straight line is actually curving.
    Therefore, it must travel a longer distance than a photon that is further from a gravity source and travels in a straight line.
    Just like with velocity time dilation, the photon must maintain the same speed, so the light clock close to a source of gravity will tick slower.
    This means that gravity can slow down time around it!
