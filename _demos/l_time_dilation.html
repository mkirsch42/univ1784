title: "Time Dilation"

<p>
    Since the scales on a moving reference frame's axes are stretched, the graph can portray time dilation.
    According to the stationary reference frame, events T and T' occurs simulataneously, so ct' appears to experience time slower.
    However, since the moving reference frame's spatial axis is angled, it sees T' occuring before T.
    In fact, when T occurs for them, it appears as though their clock is faster.
    As shown before, both reference frames argue that the other one experiences time slower!
