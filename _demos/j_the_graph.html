<p>
    The vertical axis of the graph (ct) represents the progression of time in a stationary reference frame.
    The horizontal axis (x) represents a snapshot of one-dimensional space at a given time; in other words, all events on a single line parallel to the x-axis are perceived as simulataneous.
    Events are represented by a point, while paths are represented by lines.
    A vertical line represents a stationary object, since it remains at the same x-value in space throughout time.
    Units are chosen on the graph such that the path of an object moving at the speed of light is at a 45-degree angle.
