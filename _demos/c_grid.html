<p>
    For the purposes of simplicity, spacetime is often represented as a 2D grid that bends into the 3rd dimension.
    In the absence of any massive objects, spacetime appears as a flat, square grid.
    However, massive objects bend spacetime and cause it to sag, like a bowling ball on a trampoline.
    This effect is commonly called gravity.
    When viewed from a top-down perspective, this effect seems to curve and stretch the straight lines in the grid.
