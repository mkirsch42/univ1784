    Primer is another movie that is known for its accurate time travel mechanics; however, it is a different mechanism than time dilation.
    In the beginning of the movie, Aaron and Abe are building a machine which appears to warp gravitational fields.
    The warped gravitational field creates a closed timelike curve, which is a proposed method of traveling into the past.
    The restriction of only being able to travel back to when the machine was turned on agrees with the theory, as well as the trip to the past not being instantaneous.
    This theory of bending gravity to create a closed timelike loop is very similar to <a href="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~mallett/main/papers.htm">Ronald Mallett's theory involving circulating light beams</a>.
